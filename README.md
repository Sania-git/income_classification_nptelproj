# Classification_ml_proj
A python project for exploring and analyzing the income dataset and then creating a classification model using Logistic regression and KNN.

# Classification model based on income dataset
## Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project based on the income dataset in python. The project explores the relationships between various attributes, performs statistical analyses, and builds predictive models to classify the income for the purpose of subsidy decision making.

**Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, ouliers, duplicates.
- **Visualization**:
  - Histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar plots.
  - Correlation heatmap.
- **Statistical Analysis**:
  - Correlation analysis, measures of central tendency.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Logistic regression and KNN model to classify income group for subsidies.
- **Presentation on the project**

**Insights**:
- Examined the distribution of SalStat(output variable) and its correlation with other attributes.
- Conducted statistical analysis and built Logistic regression model and KNN model to classify SalStat.
- Provided visual and analytical insights into the factors affecting SalStat.
- Compared the two models, its metrics and choose the more efficient one.

**Example Visualizations**:
- [Boxplot of SalStat vs age]
